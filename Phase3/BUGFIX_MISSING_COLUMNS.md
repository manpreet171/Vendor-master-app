# üêõ Bug Fix: Missing Columns in requirements_bundles Table

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Issue:** Operation Team Dashboard showing "0 bundles" even though bundles are marked as Reviewed

---

## üîç Root Cause

The `requirements_bundles` table was missing critical timestamp columns that were referenced in the code but never added to the database schema:

### Missing Columns:
1. ‚ùå `reviewed_at` - Timestamp when bundle was reviewed by operator
2. ‚ùå `approved_at` - Timestamp when bundle was approved

### Error Message:
```
SQL Error [207] [S0001]: Invalid column name 'reviewed_at'.
```

---

## üìä Impact

### What Broke:
- ‚úÖ `get_reviewed_bundles_for_operation()` - Query failed due to missing `reviewed_at` column
- ‚úÖ Operation Team Dashboard - Couldn't retrieve any bundles
- ‚úÖ Operator Dashboard - Bulk approve functionality referenced `approved_at`

### What Still Worked:
- ‚úÖ Marking bundles as Reviewed (status change worked)
- ‚úÖ Rejection tracking (rejection_reason and rejected_at were added)
- ‚úÖ Basic bundle operations

---

## üîß Fix Applied

### 1. Database Schema Update

**Run this SQL script:** `SQL_ADD_MISSING_COLUMNS.sql`

```sql
-- Add reviewed_at column
ALTER TABLE requirements_bundles
ADD reviewed_at DATETIME NULL;

-- Add approved_at column
ALTER TABLE requirements_bundles
ADD approved_at DATETIME NULL;
```

### 2. Code Updates

**File: `db_connector.py`**

#### A. Updated `mark_bundle_reviewed()` to set timestamp:
```python
UPDATE requirements_bundles
SET status = 'Reviewed',
    reviewed_at = GETDATE()  # NEW
WHERE bundle_id = ? AND status = 'Active'
```

#### B. Updated auto-revert logic to clear timestamp:
```python
UPDATE requirements_bundles
SET status = 'Active',
    reviewed_at = NULL  # NEW
WHERE bundle_id = ?
```

#### C. Updated `reject_bundle_by_operation()` to clear timestamps:
```python
UPDATE requirements_bundles
SET status = 'Active',
    rejection_reason = ?,
    rejected_at = GETDATE(),
    reviewed_at = NULL,    # NEW
    approved_at = NULL     # NEW
WHERE bundle_id = ? AND status = 'Reviewed'
```

#### D. Made query case-insensitive:
```python
WHERE LOWER(b.status) = 'reviewed'  # Changed from = 'Reviewed'
```

### 3. Debug Information Added

**File: `operation_team_dashboard.py`**

Added expandable debug section to show:
- Number of bundles returned by query
- Bundle names and their statuses

---

## ‚úÖ Testing Steps

### 1. Run SQL Script
```bash
# Execute SQL_ADD_MISSING_COLUMNS.sql in Azure SQL
```

### 2. Verify Columns Added
```sql
SELECT 
    COLUMN_NAME,
    DATA_TYPE,
    IS_NULLABLE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'requirements_bundles'
AND COLUMN_NAME IN ('reviewed_at', 'approved_at', 'rejection_reason', 'rejected_at')
ORDER BY COLUMN_NAME;
```

**Expected Result:**
```
approved_at        datetime     YES
rejected_at        datetime     YES
rejection_reason   nvarchar     YES
reviewed_at        datetime     YES
```

### 3. Test Workflow

**A. As Operator:**
1. Create a bundle (or use existing Active bundle)
2. Review the bundle (mark as Reviewed)
3. Verify `reviewed_at` is populated:
   ```sql
   SELECT bundle_id, bundle_name, status, reviewed_at
   FROM requirements_bundles
   WHERE status = 'Reviewed'
   ```

**B. As Operation Team:**
1. Login to Operation Team dashboard
2. Check Debug Info section
3. Should see: "Query returned: 1 bundles"
4. Bundle should be visible with Approve/Reject buttons

**C. Test Rejection:**
1. Click Reject button
2. Enter rejection reason
3. Verify bundle reverts to Active
4. Verify `reviewed_at` is cleared (NULL)
5. Verify `rejection_reason` and `rejected_at` are populated

**D. Test Re-Review:**
1. As Operator, see rejection warning
2. Fix issue
3. Review bundle again
4. Verify new `reviewed_at` timestamp
5. As Operation Team, see bundle again with previous rejection warning

## üìã Complete Column List

After fix, `requirements_bundles` table should have:

| Column | Type | Nullable | Purpose |
|--------|------|----------|---------|
| bundle_id | INT | No | Primary key |
| bundle_name | NVARCHAR(50) | No | Unique bundle identifier |
| recommended_vendor_id | INT | No | Vendor for this bundle |
| total_items | INT | Yes | Number of items |
| total_quantity | INT | Yes | Total pieces |
| status | NVARCHAR(20) | Yes | Active/Reviewed/Approved/Ordered/Completed |
| created_at | DATETIME2 | Yes | When bundle was created |
| completed_at | DATETIME2 | Yes | When bundle was completed |
| completed_by | NVARCHAR(100) | Yes | Who completed it |
| **reviewed_at** | **DATETIME** | **Yes** | **When reviewed by operator** ‚úÖ NEW |
| **approved_at** | **DATETIME** | **Yes** | **When approved** ‚úÖ NEW |
| **rejection_reason** | **NVARCHAR(500)** | **Yes** | **Why rejected** ‚úÖ NEW |
| **rejected_at** | **DATETIME** | **Yes** | **When rejected** ‚úÖ NEW |

## üéØ Lessons Learned

### 1. Schema Documentation
- Always document schema changes in main plan document
- Keep schema definitions up-to-date
- Include ALTER statements for existing tables

### 2. Testing
- Test database queries independently before UI integration
- Verify column existence before referencing in code
- Use SQL error messages to identify missing columns

### 3. Code Review
- Check that all referenced columns exist in schema
- Verify timestamp columns are populated when status changes
- Ensure timestamps are cleared when status reverts
