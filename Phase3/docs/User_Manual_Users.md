# Phase 3 Requirements App – User Manual (For Regular Users)

Welcome to the Requirements Management System. This guide explains how to submit your material needs and track them end‑to‑end. No technical knowledge is needed.

## 1) Sign In
- Open the app URL provided by your team.
- Enter your username and password, then click “Login”.
- After login you will see your name and role in the left sidebar.

If you ever need to leave the app, click “Logout” in the sidebar.

## 2) Your Home Tabs
You have four tabs at the top of the main area:
- “📦 BoxHero Items”
- “🔧 Raw Materials”
- “🛒 My Cart”
- “📋 My Requests”

Use these tabs to choose items, add them to your cart, submit a request, and check request status.

## 3) Browse and Add: BoxHero Items
The BoxHero tab is a simple step‑by‑step flow.

- Step 2: Choose a specific item name.
- Step 3: Enter the Quantity and click “🛒 Add to Cart”.
- At any point you can click “🔄 Start Over” to restart your selection.

Tips:
- If you’ve already requested an item recently, it may be hidden to avoid duplicate requests. You can still see it under “📋 My Requests”.

## 4) Browse and Add: Raw Materials
The Raw Materials tab is also a guided flow.

- Step 1: Choose a material type.
- Step 2: Choose a specific material name.

## 5) Manage Your Cart (🛒 My Cart)
See everything you’ve added.

What happens after Submit:

## 6) Track Requests (📋 My Requests)
Review past and current requests.

- Expand a request to see details: date, status, total pieces, items, and notes.
- Pending requests: You can adjust item quantities right in the request by changing “Qty” and clicking “Update”.
- In Progress / Completed: Quantities are locked and shown as read‑only.

Statuses you’ll see:
- 🟡 Pending – Your request is queued for bundling.
- 🔵 In Progress – Your request is being processed as part of a bundle.
- 🟢 Completed – Your request has been fulfilled.

## 7) Helpful Hints
- Dimensions: Where relevant, sizes are simplified (e.g., “48 × 96 × 0.125”).
- Avoid duplicates: The app hides items you’ve already requested to keep things clean.
- Need help? If you see any connection or permissions error, contact your admin/operator.

That’s it! Add items, submit, and track your requests in one place. Your procurement team will handle vendors and ordering.
