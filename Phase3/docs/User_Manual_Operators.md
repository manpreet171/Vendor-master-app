---

## 4) Active Bundles – Review, Approve, and Track Orders

Open `📦 Active Bundles` to manage the complete bundle lifecycle.

### **Bundle Status Workflow:**

Bundles move through these statuses:
1. **🟡 Active** - New bundle, needs your review
2. **🟢 Reviewed** - You've reviewed it, ready for approval
3. **🔵 Approved** - Approved for ordering
4. **📦 Ordered** - PO placed with vendor
5. **🎉 Completed** - Items received and delivered

### **Review Progress Tracking:**

At the top of Active Bundles, you'll see a simple progress indicator:
- **While reviewing**: "📊 Review Progress: 6/10 bundles reviewed • 4 remaining"
- **When complete**: "✅ All bundles reviewed! Select bundles below to approve."

### **Bulk Approval (NEW):**

**When ALL bundles are reviewed:**
- Checkboxes appear next to Reviewed bundles
- "Select All" checkbox to select all at once
- **"🎯 Approve Selected (N)"** button to approve selected bundles

**Important Rule:** You must review ALL bundles individually before you can approve ANY bundle. This ensures quality control.

### **Individual Bundle Actions:**

**For Active Bundles (🟡):**
- **"✅ Mark as Reviewed"** - Opens checklist to verify vendor, items, and duplicates
- **"⚠️ Report Issue"** - Move items to different vendors if needed

**For Reviewed Bundles (🟢):**
- **Status**: "✅ Reviewed - ready for approval"
- **"↩️ Revert"** - Revert to Active if you need to make changes

**For Approved Bundles (🔵):**
- **"📦 Order Placed"** - Record PO details when order is placed with vendor
- **"🏁 Mark as Completed"** - Disabled until order is placed

**For Ordered Bundles (📦):**
- **"🏁 Mark as Completed"** - Click when goods arrive; enter packing slip details

### **Bundle Information:**

What you'll see in each bundle panel:
- **Vendor block**: name, email, phone
- **Items table** (NEW): Professional table showing:
  - **Item column**: Item name, dimensions, total quantity
  - **User column**: Which user requested it
  - **Project column**: Project number for each request
  - **Quantity column**: Per-project quantity breakdown
- **Per-project quantities** (NEW): See exactly how many pieces each user needs for each project
- **Duplicate detection**: Alerts if multiple users requested same item for same project (only for items IN this bundle)
- **From Requests**: request numbers linked to this bundle for traceability
- **Other vendor options** (single-item bundles): View-only dropdown showing alternative vendors

**Example Table Display:**
```
| Item                    | User              | Project    | Quantity |
|-------------------------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| ACRYLITE Non-glare P99  | Production Mgr    | 📋 25-1559 | 1 pc     |
| 48 x 96 x 0.125         |                   | 📋 23-1672 | 2 pcs    |
| Total: 5 pcs            | Production Mgr2   | 📋 25-1559 | 2 pcs    |
```

### **Auto-Revert Safety Feature:**

If you move an item to a Reviewed bundle:
- The bundle automatically reverts to Active status
- You must review it again before it can be approved
- This prevents approving bundles that have changed

### **Status Filter:**

Use the dropdown to filter bundles by status:
- 🟡 Active (N) - Need review
- 🟢 Reviewed (N) - Ready to approve
- 🔵 Approved (N) - Ready to order
- 📦 Ordered (N) - Waiting delivery
- 🎉 Completed (N) - Finished
- 📋 All Bundles (N) - Show everything

## 5) Analytics Tab
Open `📊 Analytics` to view system statistics and performance metrics.

- **Bundle statistics**: Total bundles by status
- **Request statistics**: Total requests and items
- **Vendor performance**: Which vendors are used most
- **Timeline charts**: Visual representation of workflow

## 6) User Management – Admin-Only
Open `👤 User Management` to manage user accounts (admin/operator only).

- **View users**: See status, role, contact details.
  - “Full Name”, “Email”, “Department”
  - “Role”: User / Operator
  - “Active” checkbox
  - “New Password (optional)”
  - Buttons: “💾 Save Changes”, “❌ Cancel”
- **Reset Password**: Use the “Reset Password” button (enter a new password first).
- **Delete**: Click “Delete” to remove a user (only when appropriate).
- **Create User**: Fill out the form and click “Create User”.

├──────────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────┤
│ ACRYLITE Non-glare   │ 👤 Prod Mgr    │ 📋 25-1559   │    1 pc  │
