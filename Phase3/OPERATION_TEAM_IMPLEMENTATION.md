# Operation Team Role - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Feature:** Operation Team Approval Layer

---

## Overview

Added a new **Operation Team** role that provides a restricted approval layer between Operator review and final bundle approval. This creates a separation of duties where Operators review bundles and Operation Team approves/rejects them.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Changes ✅

**Table:** `requirements_bundles`

**New Columns:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE requirements_bundles
ADD rejection_reason NVARCHAR(500) NULL;

ALTER TABLE requirements_bundles
ADD rejected_at DATETIME NULL;
```

**Purpose:**
- `rejection_reason`: Stores why Operation Team rejected a bundle (max 500 chars)
- `rejected_at`: Timestamp when bundle was rejected

---

### 2. Backend Functions ✅

**File:** `db_connector.py`

**New Functions:**

1. **`get_reviewed_bundles_for_operation()`**
   - Returns all bundles with status = 'Reviewed'
   - Includes vendor info and rejection history
   - Used by Operation Team dashboard

2. **`approve_bundle_by_operation(bundle_id)`**
   - Changes status: Reviewed → Approved
   - Clears rejection data
   - Records approved_at timestamp

3. **`reject_bundle_by_operation(bundle_id, rejection_reason)`**
   - Changes status: Reviewed → Active
   - Stores rejection reason and timestamp
   - Validates reason is not empty (required)

**Modified Functions:**

1. **`get_all_bundles()`** in `operator_dashboard.py`
   - Now includes `rejection_reason` and `rejected_at` columns
   - Allows operators to see rejection information

---

### 3. Operator Dashboard Changes ✅

**File:** `operator_dashboard.py`

**Changes:**
- Added rejection warning display for Active bundles
- Shows prominent red banner when bundle was rejected
- Displays rejection date and reason
- Helps operator understand what needs to be fixed

**Visual Example:**
```
⚠️ REJECTED BY OPERATION TEAM
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Rejected on: 2025-10-15 21:45:30        │
│ Reason: Vendor pricing too high,        │
│         check alternatives              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 4. Operation Team Dashboard ✅

**File:** `operation_team_dashboard.py` (NEW)

**Features:**
- Single-purpose interface for approving/rejecting reviewed bundles
- Shows only bundles with status = 'Reviewed'
- No access to Active, Approved, Ordered, or Completed bundles
- No user management, no analytics, no other features

**What Operation Team Sees:**
- Bundle name and reviewed date
- Vendor information (name, contact, email, phone)
- Bundle summary (total items, quantity)
- Previous rejection warning (if exists)
- HTML table with per-project breakdown (expandable)

**Actions Available:**
- ✅ **Approve** button - Approves bundle (Reviewed → Approved)
- ❌ **Reject** button - Opens rejection dialog

**Rejection Dialog:**
- Text area for rejection reason (required)
- 500 character limit with counter
- Cancel and Confirm buttons
- Validation (cannot submit empty)

---

### 5. Login & Routing ✅

**File:** `app.py`

**Changes:**

1. **Added Operation Team Login:**
   - Checks credentials from Streamlit secrets: `st.secrets["app_roles"]["operation"]`
   - Fallback to environment variables: `OPERATION_USERNAME`, `OPERATION_PASSWORD`
   - Sets `user_role = 'operation'`
   - Sets `username = 'Operation Team'`

2. **Added Routing:**
   - If `user_role == 'operation'` → Load `operation_team_dashboard.py`
   - Separate from operator/admin/master routing

---

## Workflow

### Normal Approval Flow

```
1. USER submits request → Status: Pending
2. CRON JOB creates bundle → Status: Active
3. OPERATOR reviews bundle → Status: Reviewed
4. OPERATION TEAM approves → Status: Approved
5. OPERATOR places order → Status: Ordered
6. OPERATOR marks complete → Status: Completed
```

### Rejection Flow

```
1. USER submits request → Status: Pending
2. CRON JOB creates bundle → Status: Active
3. OPERATOR reviews bundle → Status: Reviewed
4. OPERATION TEAM rejects with reason → Status: Active
5. OPERATOR sees rejection reason
6. OPERATOR fixes issue
7. OPERATOR reviews again → Status: Reviewed
8. OPERATION TEAM approves → Status: Approved
9. Continue normal flow...
```

### Operator Self-Correction Flow

```
1. OPERATOR reviews bundle → Status: Reviewed
2. OPERATOR realizes mistake
3. OPERATOR reverts to Active (no reason needed)
4. OPERATOR fixes issue
5. OPERATOR reviews again → Status: Reviewed
```

## Security Notes

1. **Single Shared Login:**
   - Operation Team uses one shared account
   - No individual user tracking
   - Stored in Streamlit secrets (not database)

2. **Rejection Tracking:**
   - Only tracks LAST rejection (not full history)
   - No `rejected_by` column (always "Operation Team")
   - Rejection data cleared on approval

3. **No Escalation:**
   - No automatic escalation after multiple rejections
   - Operator must fix until approved
   - One-way flow (no operator override)

---

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. **Rejection History:**
   - Track all rejections (not just last one)
   - Show rejection count
   - Rejection trend analytics

2. **Bulk Approve:**
   - Currently: Individual approve only
   - Future: Select multiple bundles and approve at once

3. **Email Notifications:**
   - Notify operator when bundle rejected
   - Notify operation team when bundle re-reviewed

4. **Rejection Categories:**
   - Predefined rejection reasons
   - Category-based analytics

5. **Escalation Process:**
   - Automatic escalation after N rejections
   - Manager approval for disputed bundles
