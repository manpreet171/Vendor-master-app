# Bundle Review Workflow - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Feature:** "Reviewed" Status with Approval Gate System

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:**
- ❌ Operators couldn't track which bundles they had reviewed
- ❌ No visibility when bundles changed after review
- ❌ Tedious individual approval (click into each bundle)
- ❌ No enforcement to ensure complete review before approval

**After:**
- ✅ Clear progress tracking with visual indicators
- ✅ Auto-revert when bundles change (safety mechanism)
- ✅ Efficient bulk actions (select multiple, approve at once)
- ✅ Approval gate enforces 100% review before approval

## 📊 New Status Workflow

```
Active ←→ Reviewed → Approved → Ordered → Completed
  ↑         ↑           ↓
  └─────────┘         LOCKED (no changes)
```

### Status Definitions:

| Status | Icon | Meaning | Operator Actions |
|--------|------|---------|------------------|
| **Active** | 🟡 | New bundle, needs review | Mark as Reviewed, Report Issue |
| **Reviewed** | 🟢 | Reviewed and verified | Revert to Active (if needed) |
| **Approved** | 🔵 | Ready for ordering | Place Order |
| **Ordered** | 📦 | PO sent to vendor | Mark as Completed |
| **Completed** | 🎉 | Items received | View only |

### Key Rules:

1. ✅ **Active ↔ Reviewed** - Can go back and forth
2. ✅ **Reviewed → Approved** - Only when ALL bundles are Reviewed
3. ✅ **Approved = Locked** - No status changes, no item movements
4. ✅ **Bundle changes = Auto-revert** - Reviewed → Active when modified

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Changes:
**ZERO SCHEMA CHANGES!** ✅
- Uses existing `requirements_bundles.status` column
- New value: `'Reviewed'`

### New Functions (`db_connector.py`):

1. **`mark_bundle_reviewed(bundle_id)`**
   - Marks single bundle as Reviewed
   - SQL: `UPDATE requirements_bundles SET status = 'Reviewed' WHERE bundle_id = ? AND status = 'Active'`

2. **`mark_bundles_reviewed_bulk(bundle_ids)`**
   - Marks multiple bundles as Reviewed
   - Uses parameterized query with placeholders

3. **`mark_bundles_approved_bulk(bundle_ids)`**
   - Approves multiple bundles with validation
   - Checks all are Reviewed first
   - Returns: `{'success': bool, 'approved_count': int}` or error

### Modified Functions:

4. **`get_active_bundle_for_vendor(vendor_id)`**
   - **Before:** Only Active bundles
   - **After:** Active OR Reviewed bundles
   - **Critical:** No longer includes Approved (prevents modifying locked bundles)

5. **`move_item_to_vendor()`**
   - Added auto-revert logic
   - If target bundle is Reviewed → reverts to Active
   - Ensures re-review after changes

## 🎨 UI Features

### 1. Review Progress Indicator
```
📊 Review Progress: 6/10 bundles reviewed
⚠️ 4 bundle(s) need review before approval can proceed
```

### 2. Bulk Actions
- **Select All** checkbox
- **Individual checkboxes** per bundle
- **"✅ Mark as Reviewed (N)"** button
- **"🎯 Approve Selected (N)"** button (enabled only when 100% reviewed)

### 3. Status Filter
- 🟡 Active (N)
- 🟢 Reviewed (N) ← NEW
- 🔵 Approved (N)
- 📦 Ordered (N)
- 🎉 Completed (N)
- 📋 All Bundles (N)

### 4. Individual Bundle Actions

**Active Bundle:**
- Primary: "✅ Mark as Reviewed"
- Secondary: "⚠️ Report Issue"

**Reviewed Bundle:**
- Info: "✅ Bundle reviewed - use bulk approval above"
- Action: "↩️ Revert to Active"

---

## 🔒 Approval Gate Logic

```python
# Check if ALL bundles are reviewed
active_count = len([b for b in bundles if b['status'] == 'Active'])

if active_count > 0:
    # Disable approval
    st.warning(f"⚠️ {active_count} bundle(s) need review")
    st.button("🎯 Approve Selected", disabled=True)
else:
    # Enable approval
    st.success("✅ All bundles reviewed - ready to approve!")
    st.button("🎯 Approve Selected", type="primary")
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents partial approvals
- Ensures complete review
- Maintains audit trail
- Quality control gate

---

## 🔄 Auto-Revert Safety

**Scenario:** Bundle changes after review

```python
if existing_bundle.get('status') == 'Reviewed':
    # Auto-revert to Active
    UPDATE requirements_bundles SET status = 'Active' WHERE bundle_id = ?
```

**Example:**
1. Bundle B1 (Reviewed) has items A, B, C
2. Operator moves item D to B1
3. System auto-reverts B1 → Active
4. Approval button disables
5. Operator must review B1 again

## 👥 User Impact

### Regular Users (Production Team):
**ZERO IMPACT** ✅
- Still see: Pending, In Progress, Ordered, Completed
- "Reviewed" is operator-only
- No workflow changes

### Operators:
**Enhanced Workflow** ✅
- Progress tracking
- Bulk actions
- Safety mechanisms
- Visual feedback

---

## 📋 Operator Workflow Example

### Day 1 (Tuesday 10 AM - Cron Runs):
```
10 bundles created → All Active
Progress: 0/10 reviewed
Approval: DISABLED
```

### Day 1 (Afternoon):
```
Review bundles 1-6 → Mark as Reviewed
Progress: 6/10 reviewed
Approval: Still DISABLED
```

### Day 2 (Morning):
```
Review bundles 7-10 → Mark as Reviewed
Progress: 10/10 reviewed ✅
Approval: ENABLED
```

### Day 2 (Afternoon):
```
Select bundles 1-5 → Approve
Bundles 1-5: Approved
Bundles 6-10: Still Reviewed (approve later)
```

### Day 3 (Issue Found):
```
Move item from Bundle 3 to Bundle 8
Bundle 8: Auto-reverts to Active
Progress: 9/10 reviewed
Approval: DISABLED (until Bundle 8 re-reviewed)
```
